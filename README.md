# LDLCPriceChart
Simple product price tracker from ldlc.com.

This is a personnal project I made for fun and learning.
I stopped using it 2 years ago, it probably doesn't work anymore!

I made this in 2021 during the hardware shortage to track GPU prices of the models I was intersted in.
LDLC.com is a French hardware store.

It uses Node.js and Express for the server, MongoDB for the database, Puppeteer to fetch the wanted information using web scraping, and Chart.js to display a cool history price chart.
